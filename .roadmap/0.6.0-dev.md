# kcspoc v0.6.0-dev Roadmap

Theme:
From robust installer to operator-grade CLI.

Focus areas:
- Better diagnostics
- Guided workflows
- Operator education
- Internal maintainability

Includes:
- S-001: Improved check output
- S-002: Guided / unattended modes
- S-003: Better logs and summaries
- S-004: AI-powered log analysis (`kcspoc logs --analyze <hash>`)
- S-005: AI-powered report generation (`kcspoc logs --report <hash>`)
- S-006: AI-driven check evaluations (`kcspoc check --ai-eval`)
- S-007: Local Ollama integration for diagnostic assistance
- S-008: Configuration wizard support for AI services (Ollama endpoint and default model).
- **S-009: MVC Architecture Refactor**
    - S-010: Migration to `/lib/model`, `/lib/view`, `/lib/control` structure
    - S-011: Automated component discovery and sourcing
    - S-012: Development mode "functions list file" for symbol reference
    - S-013: Decoupling of UI from business logic
    - S-014: Component-based version hashing (robust versioning)
- **S-015: Universal UI & Visual Identity Standardization**
    - Define high-contrast color palette (vibrant colors for outcomes, orange for headers).
    - Refactor all table outputs to use a single unified component logic.
    - Audit all commands for consistent spacing and header usage.
- **S-016: CNI Network Policy Enforcement Validation**
    - Implement functional pod-to-pod connectivity tests (client/server) validated against a Deny-All policy in `kcspoc check --deep`.
- **S-017: Enhanced Configuration & Isolation**
    - Support for dedicated `KCSPOC_NAMESPACE` (separation of tool management from KCS application workload)
    - Preparation for test workloads and sample vulnerable pods isolation
- **S-018: Essential Environment Bootstrap**
    - Focus `prepare` on mandatory environment readiness (secrets, namespaces, prerequisites).
    - Offload granular component lifecycle management to the `extras` hub.
- **S-019: Robust Execution Lifecycle**
    - Guaranteed interruptibility (SIGINT/SIGTERM) with automated cleanup of sub-processes and UI elements.
- **S-020: Extensible Extra-Packs Architecture**
    - Decentralized infrastructure management via the `extras` hub.
    - Dynamic online discovery of supported components (extra-packs).
    - Unified component service shared across `prepare`, `destroy`, and `extras`.
- **S-021: Standardized CLI Ergonomics**
    - Implementation of standardized short-flag aliases (`-i`, `-u`, `-l`) for all primary operations.
    - Improved discovery of options via updated help documentation.
    - S-025: Logical grouping and sectioning of the configuration wizard for improved UX.
    - S-026: Standardized AI model override flag (--ai-model) for reporting-enabled commands.
    - S-027: Targeted configuration verification hub (--verify) for fast health-checks of external and internal dependencies.
- **S-022: Local Environment State Management**
    - Persistent tracking of installed extra-packs with cluster context and timestamps.
    - Authority source for tool-managed infrastructure lifecycle.
- **S-023: Universal UI Signature for Remote Assets** (Proposal)
    - Extend MVC View components to remote-first scripts (`install.sh`).
- **S-024: Centralized Reporting Hub**
    - Implementation of `kcspoc reports` management command.
    - Standardized storage schema in `~/.kcspoc/reports/` partitioned by source command.
    - Integration framework for `--report` enabled commands to persist structured artifacts.
- **S-032: AI-Integrated Multi-format Reporting Engine (HTML/MD/TXT) with Export capability.**
- **S-033: Template-driven AI Reporting Engine (Strict Content/Presentation Separation).**
- **S-028: KCS Labs Hub**
    - Automated delivery of curated playbooks and interactive safe playground environments.
    - Remote catalog fetching for dynamic lab updates.
    - Standardized playbook execution engine with step-by-step guidance.
- **S-029: AI-Powered Log Reporting**
    - Standardized AI analysis of execution logs.
    - Structured Markdown report generation based on a unified schema.
    - Integration with the Centralized Reporting Hub.
- **S-030: AI-Integrated Readiness Audit (Requirements-Driven)**
    - Implementation of an automated readiness assessment triggered by `kcspoc check --report`.
    - Cluster facts are collected into a structured format and validated against official KCS requirements using specialized AI prompts.
    - Ensures standard diagnostic terminal output remains untouched while providing a document-backed audit.
