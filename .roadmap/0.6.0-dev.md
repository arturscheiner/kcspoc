# kcspoc v0.6.0-dev Roadmap

Theme:
From robust installer to operator-grade CLI.

Focus areas:
- Better diagnostics
- Guided workflows
- Operator education
- Internal maintainability

Includes:
- S-001: Improved check output
- S-002: Guided / unattended modes
- S-003: Better logs and summaries
- S-004: AI-powered log analysis (`kcspoc logs --analyze <hash>`)
- S-005: AI-powered report generation (`kcspoc logs --report <hash>`)
- S-006: AI-driven check evaluations (`kcspoc check --ai-eval`)
- S-007: Local Ollama integration for diagnostic assistance
- S-008: Configuration wizard support for specialized AI models
- **S-009: MVC Architecture Refactor**
    - S-010: Migration to `/lib/model`, `/lib/view`, `/lib/control` structure
    - S-011: Automated component discovery and sourcing
    - S-012: Development mode "functions list file" for symbol reference
    - S-013: Decoupling of UI from business logic
    - S-014: Component-based version hashing (robust versioning)
- **S-015: Universal UI & Visual Identity Standardization**
    - Define high-contrast color palette (vibrant colors for outcomes, orange for headers).
    - Refactor all table outputs to use a single unified component logic.
    - Audit all commands for consistent spacing and header usage.
- **S-016: CNI Network Policy Enforcement Validation**
    - Implement functional pod-to-pod connectivity tests (client/server) validated against a Deny-All policy in `kcspoc check --deep`.
- **S-017: Enhanced Configuration & Isolation**
    - Support for dedicated `KCSPOC_NAMESPACE` (separation of tool management from KCS application workload)
    - Preparation for test workloads and sample vulnerable pods isolation
- **S-018: Granular Component Management**
    - Advanced lifecycle in `prepare`: installation shortcuts (`--install all`) and selective removal (`--uninstall [all|components]`)
- **S-019: Robust Execution Lifecycle**
    - Guaranteed interruptibility (SIGINT/SIGTERM) with automated cleanup of sub-processes and UI elements.
