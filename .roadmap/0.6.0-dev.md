# kcspoc v0.6.0-dev Roadmap

Theme:
From robust installer to operator-grade CLI.

Focus areas:
- Better diagnostics
- Guided workflows
- Operator education
- Internal maintainability

Includes:
- Improved check output
- Guided / unattended modes
- Better logs and summaries
- AI-powered log analysis (`kcspoc logs --analyze <hash>`)
- AI-powered report generation (`kcspoc logs --report <hash>`)
- AI-driven check evaluations (`kcspoc check --ai-eval`)
- Local Ollama integration for diagnostic assistance
- Configuration wizard support for specialized AI models
- **MVC Architecture Refactor**
    - Migration to `/lib/model`, `/lib/view`, `/lib/control` structure
    - Automated component discovery and sourcing
    - Development mode "functions list file" for symbol reference
    - Decoupling of UI from business logic
    - Component-based version hashing (robust versioning)
- **Universal UI & Visual Identity Standardization**
    - Define high-contrast color palette (vibrant colors for outcomes, orange for headers).
    - Refactor all table outputs to use a single unified component logic.
    - Audit all commands for consistent spacing and header usage.
- **CNI Network Policy Enforcement Validation**
    - Implement functional pod-to-pod connectivity tests (client/server) validated against a Deny-All policy in `kcspoc check --deep`.
- **Enhanced Configuration & Isolation**
    - Support for dedicated `KCSPOC_NAMESPACE` (separation of tool management from KCS application workload)
    - Preparation for test workloads and sample vulnerable pods isolation
- **Granular Component Management**
    - Selective component installation in `kcspoc prepare` via `--install [components]`
