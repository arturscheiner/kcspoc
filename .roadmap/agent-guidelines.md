# AI Agent Roadmap Usage Guidelines

Mandatory behavior:
- Always read .roadmap/README.md before proposing features.
- Align proposals with the active roadmap version.
- Do not propose features that violate principles.md.

Restrictions:
- Do not auto-update roadmap files.
- Do not invent roadmap items.
- Do not move items from roadmap to TODO without approval.

Expected workflow:
1. Roadmap defines intent.
2. User approves direction.
3. TODO.md captures execution tasks.
4. Implementation follows.
