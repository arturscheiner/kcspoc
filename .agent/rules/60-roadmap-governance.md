# Roadmap Governance Rule

The roadmap defines intent and direction, not execution.

Restrictions:
- Do NOT modify files under `.roadmap/` without explicit user approval.
- Do NOT convert roadmap items directly into TODO.md tasks.
- Do NOT assume roadmap items are commitments.

Allowed behavior:
- Reference roadmap items when justifying proposals.
- Suggest roadmap updates, but never apply them automatically.

If a proposal conflicts with the roadmap:
- Clearly explain the conflict.
- Ask the user how to proceed.
