# Roadmap Awareness Rule

This project has an explicit roadmap located under the `.roadmap/` directory.

Mandatory behavior:
- Always consider the roadmap before proposing new features, refactors, or behavior changes.
- Identify which roadmap phase applies (0.5.x stabilization, 0.6.x development, or future capabilities).
- Explicitly state alignment or misalignment with the roadmap in proposals.

If alignment is unclear:
- Ask for clarification before proceeding.
