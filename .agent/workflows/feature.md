description: Implement a new feature in kcspoc.
---

Steps:
1. Ask for the feature description.
2. Propose a minimal design aligned with existing architecture.
3. Implement the feature incrementally.
4. Highlight potential backward compatibility concerns.
5. Suggest a CHANGELOG.md entry (do not apply automatically).

Constraints:
- Do not modify install.sh unless explicitly requested.
- Do not assume the feature will be released immediately.
