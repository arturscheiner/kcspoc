description: Update TODO After Task Completion
---

When invoked, update the file TODO.md to reflect completed work.

Steps:
1. Identify which TODO item(s) correspond to the recently completed task(s).
2. Mark ONLY those items as completed using [x].
3. Do NOT add new TODO items.
4. Do NOT rewrite unrelated sections.
5. Preserve structure, ordering, and wording as much as possible.
6. If wording needs slight adjustment, keep it minimal and factual.

Output requirements:
- Output ONLY the updated TODO.md content.
- The result must be ready to commit as-is.

Important:
- Never assume completion unless explicitly confirmed by the user.
- If completion status is ambiguous, ask before modifying TODO.md.
