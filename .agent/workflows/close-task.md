description: Close Task (Code + TODO)
---

This workflow assists in properly closing a completed task.

Steps:
1. Verify that the task has been implemented and committed.
2. Ask the user to confirm completion if not already confirmed.
3. Update TODO.md accordingly.
4. Remind the user to verify CHANGELOG if the task was user-facing.

Do NOT perform git operations.
Do NOT modify code.
